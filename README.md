My Github account was created for CTI-110. I named it "cameronsss".
My Github repository was created to host the content I will be creating for CTI-110. I named it "cameronsss".
To clone the repository onto my local machine, I downloaded Github Desktop and logged in, then clicked 'File' in the top left, then 'Clone repository'. I selected the Github repository I named after my username. I then put it into my CTI-110 folder, inside a folder called 'Github'.
